## [0.4.0-exp] - 2024-02-29
Announcement: Heatgrids will be discontinued, as it has a few foundational issues about how it handles grids that I could probably improve if I were to start from scratch. The package will for now remain in its experimental state.

Despite its experimental state, everything in Heatgrids is working and it's working well. If you're looking for a package that can save cheap-to-store heatmaps to a server, and load them in asynchronously, then Heatgrids has got you covered!

## [0.1.0-exp] - 2023-12-27
### This is the first release of *Heatgrids*.
A customizable heatmap solution able to record and display heatmap data. Heatgrids focuses on small and efficient file sizes in order to keep storage costs low. It does not store 3D positions, but cheap coordinates on an imaginary 3D grid.
